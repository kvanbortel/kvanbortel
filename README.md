* I’m a Software Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology
* I’m familiar with web development, React, SQL, Java, C, and Python
* My goal this semester was to get to swing a steel sword around in Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) club and I did it
* I enjoy creative writing so much that sometimes friends mistake me for an English major
